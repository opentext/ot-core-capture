OpenTextâ„¢ Core Capture Services are SaaS-based capture microservices that provide capabilities to enhance images, create text-searchable PDF documents, and perform automated document classification and data extraction, including a machine-learning mechanism to improve classification and data extraction accuracy over time.  

Core Capture Services can also be used to export documents and metadata into CMIS-compatible repositories. Images and data are transitory - they only reside in the OpenText cloud while a session is open and you are actively processing the data.  Once you delete a session, all data uploaded or extracted is erased, making it easy to comply with today's privacy and security requirements.
